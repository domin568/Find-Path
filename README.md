#Find path 
Visualisation of taking shortest path in graph using Dijkstra algorithm. To draw graph I used SDL2 and SDL2_ttf (dependencies).
Project works on hardcoded graph but can be easily converted to work on randomly generated graph.

#Example of usage

#TODO
Some refactorization, make it more object oriented
